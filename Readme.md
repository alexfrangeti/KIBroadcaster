# KIBroadcaster
iBeacon simulator for iOS

Objective-C, ARC


## First steps

There are no external dependencies. Just open the KIReceiver.xcodeproject file in XCode, make sure you change the signing identity to something that allows you to run it on a device. 

The UUID, major, minor and regionId can be changed in the KIBeaconTransmitter implementation file. ( see the constants at the top ).
